# ðŸš€ Database Migration Instructions

## **Problem Solved:**
The `sketch_photo` column in the database is currently `VARCHAR(255)` which is too small for Base64 image data, causing the error:
```
error: value too long for type character varying(255)
```

## **Solution Deployed:**
âœ… **Backend**: Migration route added at `/api/migrations/fix-sketch-photo-column`  
âœ… **Frontend**: Migration utility loaded and ready to use  
âœ… **Database**: Migration script ready to run  

## **How to Run the Migration:**

### **Option 1: Browser Console (Recommended)**
1. **Open your deployed frontend**: https://web-dashboard-9tga2p0hf-vijay-patils-projects-47f43558.vercel.app
2. **Open Developer Console** (F12 â†’ Console tab)
3. **Run the migration**:
   ```javascript
   runSketchPhotoMigration()
   ```
4. **Wait for completion** - you'll see a success message

### **Option 2: Direct API Call**
If you have admin access, you can call the API directly:
```bash
curl -X POST https://explorebackend-qy7b.onrender.com/api/migrations/fix-sketch-photo-column \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## **What the Migration Does:**
- **Changes** `sketch_photo` column from `VARCHAR(255)` to `TEXT`
- **Allows** unlimited length for Base64 image data
- **Preserves** existing data
- **Verifies** the change was successful

## **Expected Result:**
After migration, your form submission should work perfectly! ðŸŽ‰

## **Verification:**
The migration will show:
- âœ… Current column type before change
- âœ… Migration completion status
- âœ… New column type after change
- âœ… Success confirmation

## **If Migration Fails:**
Check the console for error details. Common issues:
- **Authentication**: Make sure you're logged in as admin
- **Network**: Check if backend is accessible
- **Permissions**: Verify admin role access
